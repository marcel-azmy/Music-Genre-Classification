# Music Genre Classification Project with PCA and Logistic Regression

This project showcases a machine learning approach to classify music genres based on audio features. It combines dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Logistic Regression for predictive modeling. The project was completed as part of a learning experience on the 365datascience platform.

## Objective
To predict the genre of music tracks using audio feature data by reducing dimensionality with PCA and applying Logistic Regression for classification.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loading and cleaning the dataset.
   - Normalizing features for PCA compatibility.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Applying PCA to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while retaining significant variance.

3. **Classification**:
   - Implementing Logistic Regression on the reduced dataset to predict music genres.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the performance of the Logistic Regression model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technologies and Libraries
- **Python**
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
